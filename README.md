# SeMPLE mixed-effects

SeMPLE mixed-effects is a simulation-based inference framework for stochastic nonlinear mixed-effects models. It builds upon the simulation-based inference method [SeMPLE](https://github.com/henhagg/semple) that learns surrogate models for the likelihood function and the posterior distribution of model parameters. A preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11279.
